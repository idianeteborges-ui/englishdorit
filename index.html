    <h2><span class="pink-icon">💻</span> What are Computers?</h2>
    
    <p>A computer is a <strong>programmable electronic device</strong> that can accept data, process it according to instructions, and produce information. It is composed of two fundamental parts:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> These are the physical components (like a <strong>CPU</strong> memory chips, keyboard, and screen).</li>
        <li><strong>Software:</strong> These are the sets of instructions (like an <strong>Operating System</strong> or application) that tell the hardware what to do.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The ability to store, retrieve, and quickly process data makes computers indispensable tools across all modern industries.</p>
</section>

    <section id="concepts">
    <h2>🔄 How Computers Work: The Data Life Cycle</h2>
    
    <p>At its core, a computer is a system that follows a simple, repeatable process: it takes in raw information, processes it according to a program, and then presents the results. This is known as the <strong>Input-Process-Output (IPO) Cycle</strong>.</p>
    
    <div class="working-parts">
        <h3>1. Input 📥</h3>
        <p>The process begins when you provide <strong>data</strong> to the computer through <strong>input devices</strong> like a <strong> keyboard, mouse, or microphone</strong>. Input is the way of getting information <strong>into</strong> the computer that it can then process. Raw information is instantly converted into <strong>binary code</strong> (a system of ones and zeros).</p>

        <h3>2. Processing & Memory 🧠</h3>
        <p>The <strong>CPU</strong> (Central Processing Unit), often called the <strong>"brain,"</strong> is the microchip that executes commands and performs calculations. It works with two types of memory:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>RAM (Random Access Memory): </strong> This is the computer's <strong>short-term or working memory</strong>. When you open a program, it's copied into the RAM for <strong>faster access</strong>. This data is lost when the power is turned off.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage (Long-term):</strong> This is where data is kept permanently, like on a <strong>hard drive (HDD)</strong> or <strong>solid-state drive (SSD)</strong>. Data remains stored even when the power is off.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The (CPU) uses its <strong>arithmetic/logic unit</strong>to make logical decisions and perform necessary computations on the data it receives from RAM.</p>

        <h3>3. Output 🖥️</h3>
        <p>Once the data is processed and crunched, the computer presents the final <strong>results</strong>to the user through <strong> output devices</strong>. Examples include a <strong> monitor (displaying high-resolution graphics), speakers, or a printer (for a permanent form of output).</strong></p>
    </div>

    <hr class="section-divider-small">
    <h3>The Fundamental Role of Binary</h3>
    <p>At the most fundamental level, computers operate exclusively on binary code —a system of ones and zeros. These are represented by the "on" and "off" states of tiny electronic switches called transistors, which are the basic building blocks of a computer's logic gates and ultimately, its processor.</p>

    <section id="section3">
        <h2>What is the Most Important Part?</h2>
        <p>The most important part of a computer is arguably the <strong>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</strong>, often called the <strong>"brain" </strong>of the system. It is responsible for carrying out all the instructions of the computer program. Without the CPU, the computer cannot perform any calculations or run any software. Other vital parts include RAM (memory) and the Motherboard.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="section4">
        <h2>What are the Components?</h2>
        <p>Computer systems consist of various physical <strong>hardware</strong> and non-physical <strong>software</strong> components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> <strong>Input Devices:</strong>(e.g., Keyboard, Mouse, Microphone)</li>
            <li> <strong>Output Devices:</strong> (e.g., Monitor, Printer, Speakers)</li>
            <li> <strong>Processing:</strong>(e.g., CPU, GPU)</li>
            <li> <strong>Storage/Memory:</strong> (e.g., Hard Drive, SSD, RAM)</li>
        </ul>
